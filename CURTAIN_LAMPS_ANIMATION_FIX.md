# Curtain & Lamps Animation Fix

## Issue
When the curtains and lamps fall down from the top during the initial page load animation, they were overshooting their final position (going down too far) and then bouncing back up to stick to the header. This caused the top edges of these images to briefly appear on screen below where they should be.

## Root Cause

### 1. **Bounce Effect in Timing Function**
The animations were using `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` which creates an overshoot/bounce effect:
- The `1.56` value (second parameter) causes the animation to exceed its target value
- This makes the element go past 0 (its final position) before bouncing back

### 2. **Bounce Keyframes in Lamp Animation**
The lamp animation had intermediate keyframes that explicitly created a bounce:
```css
60% { transform: translateY(10px); }  /* Goes 10px past final position */
80% { transform: translateY(-5px); }  /* Bounces back up 5px */
```

## Solution

### Fixed Curtain Animation
**Before:**
```css
.curtain-hanging-lamps .curtain-image {
  animation: curtainFallDown 1.2s cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) 0.5s backwards;
}
```

**After:**
```css
.curtain-hanging-lamps .curtain-image {
  animation: curtainFallDown 1.2s ease-out 0.5s backwards;
}
```

### Fixed Lamp Animation
**Before:**
```css
@keyframes lampsFallDown {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(-200%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  60% {
    transform: translateY(10px);  /* Overshoot */
    opacity: 1;
  }
  80% {
    transform: translateY(-5px);  /* Bounce back */
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.header-hanging-lamps .lamps-image {
  animation: lampsFallDown 1.5s cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) 0.8s backwards, ...
}
```

**After:**
```css
@keyframes lampsFallDown {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(-200%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.header-hanging-lamps .lamps-image {
  animation: lampsFallDown 1.5s ease-out 0.8s backwards, ...
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Keyframes
- **Curtains**: Kept the same keyframes (already clean)
- **Lamps**: Removed the 60% and 80% bounce keyframes
- Both now smoothly transition from start to finish without overshoot

### 2. Changed Timing Function
- **From**: `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` (bounce/overshoot)
- **To**: `ease-out` (smooth deceleration)
- `ease-out` is equivalent to `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1)` - smooth with no overshoot

## Result

✅ **Curtains** now fall smoothly and stop exactly at the header position
✅ **Lamps** now fall smoothly and stop exactly at their final position
✅ **No visible edges** of images appearing below their intended position
✅ **Cleaner, more professional** animation
✅ **Same duration** and timing preserved (1.2s for curtains, 1.5s for lamps)
✅ **Same delays** preserved (0.5s for curtains, 0.8s for lamps)

## Technical Details

**Timing Function Comparison:**
- `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` - Bounce effect (value > 1 causes overshoot)
- `ease-out` - Smooth deceleration (no overshoot)

**Animation Sequence (unchanged):**
1. **0s - 0.5s**: Black screen
2. **0.5s**: Curtains start falling (duration: 1.2s)
3. **0.8s**: Lamps start falling (duration: 1.5s)
4. **1.2s**: Header slides down
5. **1.7s**: Curtains fully in place
6. **2.3s**: Lamps fully in place + glow/sway effects begin

## Files Modified
- `src/styles/modern.css`
  - Lines 34-65: Updated keyframes
  - Lines 109-117: Updated animation properties

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Lamps fall smoothly without overshoot
- [ ] No image edges visible during animation
- [ ] Glow and sway effects still work on lamps
- [ ] Animation timing feels natural
- [ ] Works on mobile devices
- [ ] Works on different screen sizes
