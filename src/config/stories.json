      "In the heart of Culinary City, long before the neon lights and the hum of traffic, there stood an old brass lamp buried beneath the sands of time. It wasn't a lamp of gold or gemstones — just a humble relic, once belonging to a young wanderer named Aladdin, famed not for his riches, but for his hunger for taste and discovery.",
      "One night, under the pale shimmer of the crescent moon, a traveler brushed the dust off that ancient lamp. And from it, with a swirl of saffron smoke and the scent of roasting lamb, a Genie emerged — not one who granted jewels or palaces, but one who whispered:",
      "\"I grant you flavors the world has forgotten.\"",
      "And thus began the tale of Aladdin Shawarma."
